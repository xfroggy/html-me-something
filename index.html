                <h3 class="full">In April of 2019, My husband and I took one of the best trips of our lives, to Palawan in the Phillipines.  Part of the trip consisted of a 5 day island hopping excursion from Coron to El Nido, Palawan.</h3>

            <p class="full">With our crew of local islanders, our excursion of a lifetime started in Coron and took us through remote islands, deserted beaches, and hidden coves of Northern Palawan over 5 days.  Each night we slept on a new, deserted island and woke to a fabulous meal cooked by our crew.
