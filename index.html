            <p>With our crew of local islanders, our excursion of a lifetime started in Coron and took us through remote islands, deserted beaches, and hidden coves of Norther Palawan over 5 days.  Each night we slept on a new, deserted island and woke to a fabulous meal cooked by our crew.

            <p>Our first night's accomodations was at the small village where one of the crew members lives.  Our hut let us know that we were definitely going to be roughing it on this excursion.  But the surroundings were beautiful and made it all worthwhile. </p>

            <p>After snorkeling and seeing various sea turtles and other fish, we arrived to our final night's accomodation after sunset and couldn't appreciate the beauty until having coffee at sunrise the next morning.  Please, never let me leave this place! </p>
